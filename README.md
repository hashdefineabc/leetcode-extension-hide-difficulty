The Leetcode Difficulty Hider Chrome Extension is a simple and easy-to-use tool that helps users hide the difficulty tag on Leetcode problems. Leetcode is a popular website for practicing coding problems and preparing for technical interviews. However, some users find it distracting or intimidating to see the difficulty level of each problem. This extension allows users to hide the difficulty tag on Leetcode problems, so we can focus on the problem itself and not be influenced by its perceived level of difficulty.
